Dear {{author}},

Thank you for sharing your scholarly articles through the open repository DSpace@MIT <http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/49433/>, in association with the MIT Faculty Open Access Policy <http://libraries.mit.edu/oapolicy>.

Our newly implemented OA Stats Service provides data about the use and reach of our open access collection. Since August 2010, {{ total_size|format_num }} articles have been downloaded from {{ total_countries }} different countries.

This service also provides information at the author and article level:

Your {{articles|format_num}} {{ articles|pluralize("article has", "articles have") }} been downloaded {{downloads|format_num}} times since {{ articles|pluralize("it was", "they were") }} deposited, from {{countries}} {{ countries|pluralize("country", "different countries") }}.

You can access more detailed download information about your articles, including per-article and per-country downloads at <http://oastats.mit.edu>.

Initially, we plan to provide this information to all authors via email in the Fall and Spring semesters.  As we seek to improve the service, we'll consider expanding options to interact with it and the underlying data.

We are anxious to hear your feedback on how this service can be most useful to you, so please send your suggestions to oastats@mit.edu.

--From the MIT Libraries
